# Sentiment Analysis on Social Media

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on social media data from Twitter and Reddit. The goal is to analyze the sentiment of the posts and visualize the results.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative, or neutral. This project uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool to classify the sentiments of posts.

## Dataset

The dataset contains social media posts from Twitter and Reddit. Each post includes:
- Text of the post
- Source (Twitter or Reddit)
- Other metadata (optional)

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the text data to remove unwanted characters and stopwords.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use the VADER sentiment analyzer to classify the posts as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of sentiments and create word clouds for each sentiment category.
5. **Optional**: Analyze sentiments by source (Twitter vs. Reddit).
